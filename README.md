### Hi, I'm Andrija Jelenkovic ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a software engineer.
- Master student in Computer Science at EPFL.
- I was lucky to grow up with computers (mostly playing games) and, since I'm extremey curious, I started learning more and more about them. That's what got me here (and hate for school, but that's another topic lol).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on .NET/Go Web Applications, memory safety of Rust -> C interop.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Disributed Systems (CS-451) and Concurrent Algorithms (CS-453) at EPFL.
- ðŸ“š Books I've read last year: [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html), [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/), [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), [Java in a Nutshell](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/java-in-a/9781098130992/), [Hugo in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/hugo-in-action), [Acing the System Design Interview](https://www.manning.com/books/acing-the-system-design-interview?ar=false&lpse=B)

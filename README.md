### Hi, I'm Andrija Jelenkovic ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a software engineer.
- Master student in Computer Science at EPFL.
- I was lucky to grow up with computers (mostly playing games) and, since I'm extremey curious, I started learning more and more about them. That's what got me here (and hate for school, but that's another topic lol).
- I'm very interested in distributed systems and I'm going to be building a distributed key-value store as my masters thesis.
